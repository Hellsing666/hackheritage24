                <p>The Pani Foundation, founded by actor Aamir Khan and his wife Kiran Rao, launched the Water Cup competition in Maharashtra. Villages across the state compete to implement watershed management techniques, such as contour trenches, check dams, and afforestation, to conserve water. Success: The initiative has led to the rejuvenation of thousands of hectares of land, improved groundwater levels, and empowered communities to become self-sufficient in water management. Villages like Hiware Bazar have become models of water sustainability.</p>
